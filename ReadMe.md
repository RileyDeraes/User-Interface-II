### Task 1: Set Up The Project With Git

Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:

- [x] Create a forked copy of this project.
- [x] Add your Team Lead as collaborator on Github.
- [x] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Lambda's by mistake!).
- [x] Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
- [x] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly.
- [x] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`.
 
### Task 2: Minimum Viable Product

 Your complete project should look similar to the wireframe you chose, and include all of the following elements:

- [x]  A navigation bar with `About`, `Projects`, and `Contact` that link to the corresponding pages
- [x]  Gallery of projects created with flexbox - you may use random images in place of project screenshots for now with the random image link: https://picsum.photos/ or you may use images that mean something to you
- [x]  Information about you in place of the given placeholder
- [x]  A `My Projects` button that links to the projects page
- [x]  A `Contact Me` button that links to the contact page
- [x]  Links to any social media profiles (Instagram, linkedIn, Twitter) into the footer section of your home page

### Task 3: Stretch Goals

The following goals are designed to stretch your knowledge and may require additional research beyond what was learned in class today.

- [x] Make your webpage work at different browser widths, including mobile
- [x] Add CSS animations
- [ ] Design and execute your own wireframe for `About`, `Projects`, and `Contact` pages
- [x] Host your website on Netlify.com

# Wireframes

From the images above, chose a wireframe to guide your design for today's project. Remember that your final project must include:

- [x]  A navigation bar with `About`, `Projects`, and `Contact` pages
- [x]  Gallery of projects created with flexbox - you may use random images in place of project screenshots for now with the random image link: https://picsum.photos/ or you may use images that mean something to you.
- [x]  Information about you in place of the given placeholder
- [x]  A `My Projects` button (doesn't need to be functional)
- [x]  A `Contact Me` button (doesn't need to be functional)
- [x]  Link navigation items to new HTML pages

Some choices are easier than others, pick something that feels right to you. 

## Submission format

Follow these steps for completing your project.

- [x] Submit a pull request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student's  Repo). **Please don't merge your own pull request**
- [x] Add your Team Lead as a reviewer on the pull request
- [x] Your Team Lead will count the project as complete by merging the branch back into master
